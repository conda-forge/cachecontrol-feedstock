  summary: 'The httplib2 caching algorithms packaged up for use with requests'
  description: |
    CacheControl is a port of the caching algorithms in httplib2 for use with
    requests session object.
    It was written because httplib2's better support for caching is often
    mitigated by its lack of threadsafety. The same is true of requests
    in terms of caching.
